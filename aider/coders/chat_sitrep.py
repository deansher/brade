class ChatSitRep:
    """
    The ChatSitRep (Situation Report) class encapsulates an analyzed summary of the chat history.
    It is designed to provide the necessary context for prompt generation without exposing
    the raw chat messages. This abstraction allows for more sophisticated prompt creation
    based on insights derived from the conversation, such as user intents, past assistant actions,
    and conversation flow.

    Future implementations of this class will include methods and attributes that represent
    the analyzed state of the conversation, enabling more context-aware and intelligent responses
    from the assistant.
